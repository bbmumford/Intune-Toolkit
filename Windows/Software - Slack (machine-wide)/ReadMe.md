## Steps

### 1. Prepare the Script
The `Application_Downloader&Installer.ps1` script does not need modification. Instead, the app deployment can be configured dynamically using command-line arguments when deploying through Intune.

### 2. Package the Script
1. Place the script (`Application_Downloader&Installer.ps1`) in a folder.
2. Use the [Win32 Content Prep Tool](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool) to convert the folder into a `.intunewin` package:
   - Open a Command Prompt as Administrator.
   - Run the following command:
     ```cmd
     IntuneWinAppUtil.exe -c <source_folder> -s Application_Downloader&Installer.ps1 -o <output_folder>
     ```
     Replace:
     - `<source_folder>`: Path to the folder containing the script.
     - `<output_folder>`: Path to save the `.intunewin` file.

### 3. Add the App to Intune
1. Go to the **Microsoft Intune admin center**: [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com).
